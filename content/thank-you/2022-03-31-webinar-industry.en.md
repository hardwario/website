<h3 class = "font-weight-black mb-20">The topic</h3>

<p class = "pb-25">In our March webinar, we will therefore focus on this topic. We will present the possibilities of remote energy readings and show how energy audits of production and operations can be easily carried out.</p>

<p class = "pb-25">Using practical examples, we will demonstrate IoT applications for the most commonly monitored energies (electricity, water, gas, air) in cities and manufacturing plants.</p>

<p class = "pb-25">We will also outline IoT monitoring trends for alternative energy sources such as heat pumps.</p>
