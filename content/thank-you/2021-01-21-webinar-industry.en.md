<p>In the January IoT webinar, we will discuss how we helped our partner - Belgian company Unifly - designe and manufacture a system for remote identification of drones - Unifly BLIP (Broadcast Location & Identification Platform). The system enables electronic identification of drones and remote position tracking. It shares data both locally via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and remotely via NB-IoT.</p>
