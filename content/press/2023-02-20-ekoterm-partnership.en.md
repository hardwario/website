*February 20, 2023* – **EKOTERM is a heat supplier and operator of gas boiler houses and heat exchangers with more than 30 years of history. During its existence, it has deployed many innovative solutions with its customers. It has now agreed on a partnership in the field of IoT with HARDWARIO which provides its partners with a comprehensive solution of hardware, services and expert support to facilitate IoT adoption. HARDWARIO will help EKOTERM with the implementation of IoT technologies in its products and services.**

The two companies have agreed on a cooperation in which HARDWARIO will help EKOTERM with the implementation of IoT technologies in managed boiler rooms and heat exchangers. The aim is to significantly improve the quality of services offered by remote monitoring and control of boiler room technologies and to significantly simplify service work.

*"We have hundreds of boiler houses and heat exchanger stations under our management all over the Czech Republic and their number is growing rapidly. This is mainly due to our pro-customer and innovative approach to the whole industry. We believe that connecting boiler room technologies to the Internet of Things will bring savings to our customers, contribute to the environment, and significantly increase our efficiency and quality of service, as well as enable us to respond more quickly to emergencies. We also believe that a prerequisite for successful implementation of IoT in our products is to work with a reliable partner who can meet our needs and help us with the delivery of hardware, connectivity and integration with our unique cloud-based monitoring system. HARDWARIO is undoubtedly such a partner for us,"* says Petr Kuhn, CTO of the company.

*"What we appreciate about the entire EKOTERM team is their approach to innovation in this relatively conservative industry. Together, we want to bring great innovative products that will help EKOTERM win more customers while maintaining the current quality of service without major expansion of the service team. It will be a long-standing partnership that will benefit both companies, but most importantly EKOTERM's customers,"* adds Alan Fabik, co-founder of HARDWARIO.
