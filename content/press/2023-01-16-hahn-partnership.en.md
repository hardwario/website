*16 January 2023* – **HAHN & Sohn, a leading European supplier of power generators, has agreed to an IoT partnership with HARDWARIO, which provides its partners with a comprehensive solution of hardware, services, and expert support to facilitate IoT adoption. HARDWARIO will help HAHN to implement IoT technologies into its products and services.**

The two companies have agreed to a collaboration in which HARDWARIO will help HAHN implement IoT technologies into existing products and services. The aim is to enable end users of power generators to monitor and control them remotely

*"We have been successfully supplying our power generators to customers throughout Europe. We believe that by connecting to the Internet, their attractiveness and our competitiveness will increase substantially.
