*March 13, 2023* – **ZAT supplies intelligent control systems for various industries worldwide. Since 2018, it has been developing the SimONet software platform for processing and visualizing data from IoT devices. It has now entered into a contract with HARDWARIO to develop an IoT monitoring system for the cathodic protection of pipelines.**

The agreed long-term cooperation includes developing a special module for remote cathodic protection monitoring, which will be part of the CHESTER IoT gateway ecosystem. The project aims to create a new service for ZAT customers that enables online monitoring of cathodic protection functionality. The new service will be offered globally and will use modern NB-IoT and LTE-M transmission technologies as well as satellite transmissions. 

*"We are a major European player in the supply of control systems to many industries. We are investing in new technologies such as the Internet of Things. For these purposes, we are developing the SimONet software platform, for which we are looking for suitable IoT projects. We see IoT monitoring of cathodic protection of pipelines as very promising, where we have already identified customers. When selecting a suitable IoT hardware and connectivity supplier, we turned to the HARDWARIO team, with whom we have successfully cooperated in the past. They are experts in the field of industrial IoT. Therefore we are sure that cooperation will bring us the required quality of the entire solution and success on the market,"* says Václav Janoch, Sales and Marketing Director of the company.

*"We have developed several IoT products for ZAT in the past and are excited to continue our collaboration. We see ZAT's competence and strength in the energy sector in particular, as well as the strengths of the SimONet platform. We are starting a cathodic protection monitoring project to fully exploit the potential of our IoT gateway CHESTER and IoT transmission technologies NB-IoT and LTE-M. We are also looking forward to deploying our satellite module in places without terrestrial network coverage. An equally important aspect of the cooperation with ZAT is the longevity, which will surely give birth to other interesting solutions,"* adds Alan Fabik, co-founder of HARDWARIO.
