<p>By digitizing and implementing IoT technologies, smart organizations gain a competitive advantage by dramatically improving their efficiency, productivity, customer experience, and generating new revenue streams. In our popular webinars, together with our partners, we present successful IoT projects and openly describe used solutions and technologies. The webinar includes a discussion with developers, implementers and customers.</p>

<p>In our new IoT webinar, we will show you how RGS Care uses our <strong>IoT multisensor COOPER</strong> as part of their care services. We will talk not only about the COOPER multisensor, but we will also analyze used <strong>LPWAN technologies</strong> and introduce the <strong>Ubidots platform</strong>.</p>
