<p class = "pt-15 pb-15">
<strong>When:</strong> 31 March at 3 pm CET<br/>
<strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>


<p class = "pb-15">The current extreme increase in energy prices creates pressure to optimise consumption and find possible savings. As a result, IoT energy monitoring is now the most demanded IoT application, especially in industry.</p>

<p class = "pb-25">In our March webinar, we will therefore focus on this topic. We will present the possibilities of remote energy readings and show how energy audits of production and operations can be easily carried out.</p>

<p class = "pb-25">Using practical examples, we will demonstrate IoT applications for the most commonly monitored energies (electricity, water, gas, air) in cities and manufacturing plants.</p>

<p class = "pb-25">We will also outline IoT monitoring trends for alternative energy sources such as heat pumps.</p>


<h3 class = "font-weight-bold font-20 pb-10">In the webinar, we will cover the following topics:</h3>
<ul class = "pb-15">
<li class = "pb-0">The most frequently monitored energies.</li>
<li class = "pb-0">Methods of energy consumption metering.</li>
<li class = "pb-0">Optimising consumption based on an energy audit.</li>
<li class = "pb-0">Practical examples of use in the city, brewery, restaurant and manufacturing company.</li>
<li class = "pb-0">Monitoring photovoltaics and heat pumps.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class = "font-weight-bold font-20 pb-10">Speakers:</h3>
<ul class = "pb-15">
<li class = "pb-0">Alan Fabik, CEO HARDWARIO</li>
<li class = "pb-0">Pavel Hübner, CTO HARDWARIO</li>
