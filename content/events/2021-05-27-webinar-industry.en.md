<strong>When:</strong> May 27, 16:00 CET<br/>
<strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>

<p>In our next popular IoT webinar, we will focus on non-invasive measurement of production equipment efficiency.</p>

<p>Thanks to the new technologies of the Internet of Things, it is now possible to monitor any production facility easily, quickly and without great costs, because we do not need to intervene in the machine, processes or establish a network connection to the machine.</p> 

<h3 class="font-weight-black font-22 font-md-28 pb-10 font-md-lnh32">During the webinar you will learn:</h3>

<ul>
     <li class = "mb-0 pb-0">How IoT technologies have simplified and reduced the cost of production monitoring.</li>
     <li class = "mb-0 pb-0">What can a management report look like, which you will have 15 minutes after deploying the system.</li>
     <li class = "mb-0 pb-0">How much does the deployment of non-invasive efficiency measurement cost.</li>
     <li class = "mb-0 pb-0">What results did the deployment of measurements after 1 month in ArcelorMittal Tubular Products Karvina bring</li>
</ul>
