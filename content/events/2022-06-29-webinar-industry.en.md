<p class = "pt-15 pb-15">
<strong>When:</strong> June 29, 3 pm CET (8 am CDT / 14 pm GMT+1)<br/>
<strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>

<p class = "pb-15">LPWANs bring the opportunity to connect things to the Internet from almost anywhere, thanks to signal availability, low cost connectivity and low power consumption. Moreover, with the advent of low-power satellite networks, we can drop the word "almost" from the previous statement and connect things from really anywhere.</p>

<p class = "pb-25"><strong>In our June webinar, we'll discuss LPWANs and satellite technologies. We will not only focus on theory and technology comparisons, but also on practical experiences and projects.</strong> In fact, the entire HARDWARIO team has been involved in the LPWAN world since the very beginning of their existence and during that time we have been present at hundreds of successful and unsuccessful projects.</p>

<h3 class = "font-weight-bold font-20 pb-10">During the webinar we will address the following questions:</h3>
<ul class = "pb-15">
<li class = "pb-0">What LPWAN technologies have succeeded so far?</li>
<li class = "pb-0">What LPWAN technologies do we see as the most promising?</li>
<li class = "pb-0">What are the benefits of satellite-based low-power networks and what is their availability?</li>
<li class = "pb-0">What are the practical and popular projects using LPWANs?</li>
</ul>

<h3 class = "font-weight-bold font-20 pb-10">Who will lead the webinar</h3>
<p class = "pb-25">The webinar will be led by HARDWARIO founders Alan Fabik and Pavel Hübner, who have practical experience with LPWAN technologies in deployments with companies such as ŠKODA AUTO, E.ON and LEGO.<p>
