<p class = "pt-15 pb-15">
<strong>When:</strong> June 29, 3 pm CET (8 am CDT / 14 pm GMT+1)<br/>
<strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>

<p class = "pb-15">LPWAN transmission technologies allow us to connect things to the Internet from almost anywhere - thanks to high signal availability, low-cost connectivity and the possibility of several years of battery life. Moreover, with the advent of low-power satellite networks, we can drop the word "almost" from the previous statement and connect things from anywhere in the world. </p>

<p class = "pb-25"><strong>The benefits and technical aspects of LPWAN and satellite technologies will be covered in our June webinar. We will focus on theory and practical experience from our successful IoT projects.</strong></p>

<h3 class = "font-weight-bold font-20 pb-10">During the webinar, we will address the following questions: </h3>
<ul class = "pb-15">
<li class = "pb-0">Which LPWAN technologies have been successful so far? </li>
<li class = "pb-0">Which LPWAN technologies do we see as the most promising? </li>
<li class = "pb-0">What do satellite low-power networks bring, and what is their availability?</li>
<li class = "pb-0">What are the practical and popular projects using LPWANs?</li>
</ul>

<h3 class = "font-weight-bold font-20 pb-10">Who will lead the webinar</h3>
<p class = "pb-25">The webinar will be led by the founders of HARDWARIO: Alan Fabik and Pavel Hübner. They have practical experience with LPWAN technologies in deployments with companies such as ASAHI, ŠKODA AUTO and LEGO.<p>
