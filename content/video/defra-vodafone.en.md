Watch the recording of the IoT webinar about how, together with Vodafone UK, we had handled the challenge of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of the United Kingdom and made it easier to collect data to research the impact of climate change on tree growth.

We talked about the implementation of NB-IoT technology, HARDWARIO CHESTER and EMS Dendrometer devices, REST API and Grafana application.
