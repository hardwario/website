In our next popular IoT webinar, we focused on the non-invasive measurement of production equipment efficiency.

Thanks to the new technologies of the Internet of Things, it is now possible to monitor production easily, quickly and affordably, because we do not need to change or replace the machine, processes or establish a network connection.

During the video you will learn:
- How IoT technologies have simplified and reduced the cost of production monitoring.
- What can a management report look like, which you will have 15 minutes after deploying the system?
- How much does the deployment of non-invasive efficiency measurement cost?
- What results did the deployment of the system after a month in ArcelorMittal Tubular Products Karvina bring?
