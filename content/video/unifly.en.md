Watch the recording of the IoT webinar where we discussed How we'd helped our partner - Belgian company Unifly - design and manufacture a system for remote identification of drones - Unifly BLIP (Broadcast Location & Identification Platform). The system enables electronic identification of drones and remote position tracking. It shares data both locally via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and remotely via LTE.
