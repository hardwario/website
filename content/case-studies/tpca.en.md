**TPCA** is a joint venture of two **global automobile** enterprises: Japanese Toyota Motor Corporation and French Groupe PSA. It manufactures large quantities of **Toyota, Peugeot and Citroën** passenger cars in Ovčáry, near Kolín. In 2017, they even surpassed a significant milestone of 3 million cars produced.

Such a large and global plant needs to **operate within its maximum capabilities**. In order to deliver high-quality cars to customers as efficiently as possible, it is constantly seeking for **innovative and progressive ways** to eliminate and prevent defects. That is why they asked for our co-operation in finding an efficient and low-cost solution to **predict potential problems in production**.
