The history of ArcelorMittal Tubular Products Karvin√° dates back to 1918. Its primary focus is producing and selling longitudinally welded steel thin-walled profiles and tubes and thin-walled open profiles.

**Challenge: We do not have accurate production data**

Before we have started the cooperation, the company only used data collected locally by the operators or data that was only available retrospectively. Although most machines have a PLC, none of them is connected to the Internet, and the data is not processed. Our task was to obtain basic information about production efficiency from the machines and pass it on clearly to the management and the internal IT department.
