IFRAMIX is the market leader in animal feed. It is a member of CCPA, a leading French group in its industry. Their success is based on long-term research. They are constantly developing new natural products that reduce the number of medicines used and maintain excellent **health** medical condition of the animals. One of their current topics is the prevention of animal stress provoked by, for instance, inappropriate temperature and humidity on farms. Due to this, farmers face substantial economic losses, especially during the summer.

**IFRAMIX has asked us for a set of mobile sensors to detect this problem.**
