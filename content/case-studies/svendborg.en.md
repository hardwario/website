Jan Mikyska is the exclusive supplier and service organization of the Danish company Svendborg Brakes in Czechia and Slovakia. Their wish was to gain remote access to the operating information of the hydraulic brake system and to facilitate maintenance. Requirements included a connection to the Internet and a battery-operated device.

We have carried out a telemetry project for a mining surface excavatorâ€˜s Svendborg Brakes brake system.
