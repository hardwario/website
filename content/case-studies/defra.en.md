**Forest Research, is the research agency of the Forestry Commission and part of the British Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).** It is Great Britain’s principal organisation for forestry and tree related research and is internationally renowned for the provision of evidence and scientific services in support of sustainable forestry.

Forest Research’s vision is to be the world leader in applied forest science and a trustworthy and recognized provider of expertise, data, products and services to the government and the tree, wood, forest and natural resources sectors, thereby fulfilling the UK government’s strategy “A Green Future: Our 25 Year Plan to Improve the Environment”.
