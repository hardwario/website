Thanks to our technological know-how and experience from real IoT projects, we prepare attractive educational programs for entities providing formal and non-formal technical education. The programs are based on our scientifically validated pedagogical framework for active STEM teaching. We can modify our IoT equipment according to the educational plan, including pricing policy and branding.
