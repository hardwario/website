Longtime friends from eMan have solidified our strategic collaboration with an equity investment in our company. This investment will help us accelerate our international expansion, expand our service portfolio and improve our technical and business support to our partners. The first joint product will be the HARDWARIO Manager mobile application, which will make it easier for all users to set up and manage HW our platforms. And other great products will follow.

By combining our sales and marketing activities, both companies plan to strengthen their position not only in the Czech market. We will share our offices in the UK and the US and continue to expand into other markets, including the newly opened office in Poland, Latin America, Australia and last but not least, the DACH region, where we are negotiating with our first major partner.

*"We are thrilled to see the success of eMan, and I believe that with joint products, we can succeed in many industries. We will now focus primarily on the digitalization of the energy sector and bring meaningful solutions not only to the big players in the industry,"* comments Alan Fabik, CEO of HARDWARIO.

We will help eMan expand their portfolio of products and services, which has focused primarily on software solutions and applications.

*"Our strategic goal was to expand eMan's portfolio with scalable products that address the full breadth of customer needs. Therefore, we needed to complement our applications with hardware and control the final solution. After the previous experience of both teams working together, we can safely say that together we are able to create extraordinary products,"* explains Jiří Horyna, Chairman of the Board of eMan.
