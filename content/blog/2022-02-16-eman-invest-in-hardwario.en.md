From the capital investment in the order of millions of crowns, eMan expects to expand its portfolio of services and products, which until now has been focused primarily on software solutions and applications.

"Our strategic goal was to expand eMan's portfolio with scalable products that address the full breadth of customer needs. Therefore, we needed to complement our applications with hardware and control the final solution. After the previous experience of both teams working together, we can safely say that together we are able to create extraordinary products," explains Jiří Horyna, Chairman of the Board of eMan.

"We are thrilled to see the success of eMan, and I believe that with joint products, we can succeed in many industries. We will now focus especially on the digitalization of the energy sector and bring meaningful solutions not only to the big players in the industry," comments Alan Fabik, CEO of HARDWARIO.

By combining their sales and marketing activities, the two companies plan to strengthen their positions in the Czech market and beyond the Czech Republic. With the ambition of expanding beyond the Czech Republic, the companies want to establish themselves primarily in the United States and the United Kingdom, where they already have offices. Together, they intend to expand to other countries in Europe, Australia and Latin America.
