title: Data Telemetry from Offline Devices
description: CHESTER can connect a wide offering of various communication interfaces and collect data from devices which are not normally connected online. That, for instance, allows industrial machines monitoring.
device: CHESTER
examples: ["Overall equipment efficiency (OEE) measurement","Data telemetry from brake system on a mining machine","Cathodic protection monitoring of distribution pipes","Industrial weight scale monitoring"]
extensions: [["External analog inputs 0 - 28 V","CHESTER-X0C"],["1-Wire","CHESTER-X1"],["TTL/CMOS UART","CHESTER-X2A"],["RS-485 - MODBUS", "CHESTER-X2B"],["Current loop input 4 - 20 mA","CHESTER-X4C"], ["Weight scale", "CHESTER-X6"]]

[CHESTER](/chester/) can connect a wide offering of various communication interfaces and collect data from devices which are not normally connected to the internet, or local area network.

The solution is suitable for data telemetry projects in the industry, retail, and warehouses, thanks to its water/dust resistance and wide operating temperature range.

The low power consumption and LPWAN connectivity allow deployment in places not covered by the GSM signal or power grid.
