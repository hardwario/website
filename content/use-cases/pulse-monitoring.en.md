It is possible to easily use [CHESTER](/chester/) for pulse monitoring. It is especially useful for energy metering projects and water use statistics. The device typically connects to a pulse output of an electricity meter, gas meter, and water flow meter. Eventually, the optical energy meter output can be used.

Project examples:

* Monitoring of electricity meters
* Gas meter monitoring
* Monitoring of water meters
* Measurement of the cycle of the production machine
* Monitoring the number of quality or defective pieces of the production line

Low consumption and LPWAN connectivity (NB-IoT, or LoRa) enable deployment even in places not covered by the GSM signal or power grid.
