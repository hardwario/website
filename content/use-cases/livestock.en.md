HARDWARIO devices can process data from a wide range of environmental sensors, such as temperature, relative humidity, nitrogen and sulfur oxides, soil moisture and more. This allows you to monitor the conditions of animal husbandry online.

For these projects we use [IoT Hub CHESTER](/chester/). Thanks to its resistance to dust and water and temperature range, it is a suitable solution for demanding outdoor projects in the field of agriculture, forestry, water management and industry.

Low consumption and LPWAN connectivity (NB-IoT, or LoRa) enable deployment even in places not covered by the GSM signal or power grid.
