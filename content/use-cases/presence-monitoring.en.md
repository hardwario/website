Thanks to the PIR module or the Infra Grid module, it is possible to detect the movement of people with the [IoT Kit TOWER](/kit/) or the COOPER device and thus create an independent burglar alarm device. The solution can be integrated with your own system or available applications such as Blynk, Ubidots and others.

Data can be transmitted locally via Sub-GHz radio or using LPWAN technologies NB-IoT, LoRaWAN and Sigfox. The device lasts to run up several years on batteries.
