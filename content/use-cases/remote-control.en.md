[CHESTER](/chester/) finds its place in applications where remote control of machines or devices is required - e.g., opening and closing doors and gates, commanding the production machines, etc.

The solution is suitable for demanding outdoor projects thanks to its water/dust resistance and wide operating temperature range.

The low power consumption and LPWAN connectivity allow deployment in places not covered by the GSM signal or power grid.
