Do you need to monitor temperature and humidity to control the quality of the environment for production, energy monitoring or audits? The HARDWARIO wireless solution does not require a network connection and is battery powered. This makes it possible to solve, for example, the following projects:

* Audit of production conditions
* Monitoring of product storage conditions
* Monitoring of TH index of animal husbandry

For these projects we use [IoT Hub CHESTER](/chester/). Thanks to its resistance to dust and water and temperature range, it is a suitable solution for demanding outdoor projects in the field of agriculture, forestry, water management and industry.

Low consumption and LPWAN connectivity (NB-IoT, or LoRa) enable deployment even in places not covered by the GSM signal or power grid.
