Through the connected industrial RTD thermometers and thermocouples support, [CHESTER](/chester/) can measure extreme temperatures in industrial applications.

The solution is suitable for use in boiler rooms, metal industry, chemical industry, or building materials, thanks to its water/dust resistance and wide operating temperature range.

The low power consumption and LPWAN connectivity allow deployment in places not covered by the GSM signal or power grid.
