You can equip [CHESTER](/chester/) or [TOWER](/kit/) with one or more push buttons and monitor the press events online, send notification, e-mail or use callbacks to integrate them with other systems. 

**Project examples:**

* ANDON 
* Emergency button for people in need
* Vigilance button
* Registration and notification systems

The solution is suitable for demanding outdoor projects thanks to its water/dust resistance and wide operating temperature range in the field of agriculture, forestry, water management and industry.

The low power consumption and LPWAN connectivity allow deployment in places not covered by the GSM signal or power grid.
