Monitor the condition of your equipment and its environment on a long-term basis in order to prevent problems that could significantly limit the operation of your production.

With a wide range of interfaces, you can connect and collect data with HARDWARIO products from devices that are not normally connected to the Internet or an internal computer network. Thanks to this, you can digitize the machine and capture situations where unexpected changes occur in time by long-term monitoring. Examples of [predictive maintenance projects](/blog/2020-03-05-predictive-maintenance/) include:

* Production temperature monitoring of production lines
* Pulse monitoring for power and consumption measurement
* Rotation monitoring
* Ultrasonic monitoring of the sump level
* Vibration monitoring

For these projects we use IoT Hub CHESTER or IoT Kit TOWER.

Thanks to its resistance to dust and water and temperature range, CHESTER is a suitable solution for demanding projects in the field of agriculture, forestry, water management and industry.

Low consumption and LPWAN connectivity (NB-IoT, or LoRa) enable deployment even in places not covered by the GSM signal or power grid.
