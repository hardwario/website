With a connected ultrasonic sensor, [CHESTER](/chester/) can measure distance - e.g., a water level or a gap between a solid object. You will get online data about measured distance or when the lower or upper limits are exceeded.

Examples of projects:

* Level measurement of rainwater sumps in apartment buildings
* Level measurement in wells and cesspools
* Silo fullness monitoring
* Monitoring the level of emulsion tanks

Thanks to its resistance to dust and water and temperature range, CHESTER is a suitable solution for demanding projects in the field of agriculture, forestry, water management and industry.

Low consumption and LPWAN connectivity (NB-IoT, or LoRa) enable deployment even in places not covered by the GSM signal or power grid.
