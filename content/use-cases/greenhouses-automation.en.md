HARDWARIO IoT devices can be used to monitor physical quantities such as temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, CO2 and respond to values with the required actions - turning on irrigation, opening windows, etc.

Data can be transmitted locally via Sub-GHz radio or using LPWAN technologies NB-IoT, LoRaWAN and Sigfox. Thanks to low power consumption, the devices can run on batteries for several years.
