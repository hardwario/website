## Introduction

{{< perex >}} Even a mobile phone isn¬¥t infallible! It may sometimes let you down and not wake you up. If it happens to you, don't despair. Press üëá the smart button to apologize to your teacher before they inform your parents. {{< /perex >}}

Under this project, you will learn **how to send an e-mail using a smart button**. üì©

All you need for this is the basic HARDWARIO [**Starter Kit**](https://shop.hardwario.com/starter-kit/).

{{< modules >}}

## Make it happen in Node-RED

1. Put the Starter Kit together and pair it: If you are doing this for the first time, [we've prepared a simple guide for you](/handbook/). You need the radio push button firmware for the Core Module. If you don't know how to download the firmware or what it is,[you can find out here](/academy/how-to-flash-firmware/).
2. In Playground, click the **Functions tab** where the [Node-RED](/academy/what-is-node-red/) programming area is.ü§ñ
3. Place the **MQTT** node from the Input section on the Node-RED area.
![MQTT](https://res.cloudinary.com/lukasfabik/image/upload/v1573312451/projects/poslani-e-mailu-uciteli-s-omluvenkou-z-vyucovani/image6.png)

4. In the node, set the key function, i.e. push button. Double-click on the node and **copy the following line into the Topic field**:

```
node/push-button:0/push-button/-/event-count
```

Confirm with the **Done** button.

## Set content of the apology

1. You also determine the content of the apology in Node-RED. Place **Change node** from the Functions section next to the MQTT node. This determines what e-mail is sent.

2. Double-click on the node and set two rules in the **Rules** field (see screenshot below).

The first rule will be **msg. payload **: this sets the message content. Keep in mind that the node is not familiar with Czech accent marks (ƒç√°rky) and hooks (h√°ƒçky) and don't forget to sign it. The message may read like this:

_Dear Mr. Woodpecker, I'm sorry, but unfortunately my dog ate my alarm clock. I'll come a.s.a.p. Evzen (your favorite pupil, who does not deserve to have a note sent home to his parents)._

In the second rule, which you add by pressing the **\+ add** button below, you fill in **msg. topic**. This will be the subject matter of the e-mail. For example _Apology_ for _being late_.

![Rules](https://res.cloudinary.com/lukasfabik/image/upload/v1573312453/projects/poslani-e-mailu-uciteli-s-omluvenkou-z-vyucovani/image11.png)

Confirm with the **Done** button.üëè

## Start the app on your mobile

1. **Continue on your mobile.**. The e-mail is sent to the teacher at the touch of the button via the **Blynk** app. üì± If you don't know Blynk yet from other projects, [ find out how to start it](/academy/how-to-connect-blynk/).

2. Select **E-mail** from the menu. ‚úâÔ∏è The button is placed on the project desktop.

{{< /middle >}}

3. Clicking on the button takes you to settings. Here, set up your teacher's e-mail address to send your apology.

{{< middle >}} {{< img src = "https://res.cloudinary.com/lukasfabik/image/upload/v1573312451/projects/poslani-e-mailu-uciteli-s-omluvenkou-z-vyucovani/image1.jpg" alt = "nastaven√≠ e-mailu" >}} {{< /middle >}}

When you are finished, return to the desktop via the top left arrow and activate Blynk with the Play button in the top right.

## Set up sending e-mails

1. Now return to Playground. Add **E-mail node** from Blynk ws after your flow. üìÆ
![E-mail node](https://res.cloudinary.com/lukasfabik/image/upload/v1573312453/projects/poslani-e-mailu-uciteli-s-omluvenkou-z-vyucovani/image9.png)

2. Double-click on the node and fill in the teacher's e-mail address on the **E-mail** line.
![E-mail](https://res.cloudinary.com/lukasfabik/image/upload/v1573312453/projects/poslani-e-mailu-uciteli-s-omluvenkou-z-vyucovani/image8.png)

3. Then click on **the pencil** next to the **Connection** line and set some more details. In the **Auth Token** field, copy the code that Blynk sent to your e-mail account.
**In the URL field, copy the address** from the bottom of the window (see screenshot) and give the function a name in the Name field, for example _Apology_.

## Ready, steady‚Ä¶ go!

1. Do you want to try it? **Change the e-mail address to your own for testing purposes**.
2. Confirm with Deploy again, then just press the button and ... hey presto, **someone's writing you**! üíå
