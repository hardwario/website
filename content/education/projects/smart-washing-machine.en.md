## Introduction

{{< perex >}}
Raise the IQ of your family washing machine. ü§ñ Using the IoT box, programme a notification to let your parents know that the load has been finished.
{{< /perex >}}

In this project, you will learn to set up the box so that it recognizes when the washing machine is finished and sends a notification to the mobile. üì± üëà

All you need is the box with the button and the USB dongle. You will be all set with the basic HARDWARIO kit - the [Starter Kit](https://shop.hardwario.com/starter-kit/).

{{< modules >}}

## Download new firmware

1. If you haven‚Äôt done it yet, [put together]({{< ref "/education/tutorials/handbook.en.md" >}}) the Starter Kit.
2. Upload new firmware to the Core Module - **bcf-radio-washing-machine-monitor** (you will find it among other firmware in the Playground). Thanks to this firmware, the box will be more sensitive to vibrations of the washing machine. üîÉ

**Our tip:** If you don‚Äôt know how to download the firmware or what it is, [you will find out here]({{< ref "/education/tutorials/how-to-flash-firmware.en.md" >}}).

3. [Pair the Core Module with the USB Dongle]({{< ref "/education/tutorials/how-to-pair-kit.en.md" >}}). Right after pairing it, you will see that your Core Module changed Alias to **washing-machine-detector**. üëå

## Get it started in the Node-RED

1. In the Playground, click on the **Functions tab**, where the [Node-RED]({{< ref "/education/tutorials/what-is-node-red.en.md" >}}) programming desktop is located. ü§ñ
2. Start as usual: first, place the **MQTT node** from the Input section on the desktop.

Double-click on it and copy **Topic** in the field. With this, the box will know when the washing machine stops shaking:

```
node/washing-machine-detector:0/washing/finished
```

{{< img src = "https://res.cloudinary.com/lukasfabik/image/upload/v1566368245/projects/smart-washing-machine/image2.png" alt = "Check alias of HARDWARIO kit" >}}

Confirm it with the **Done** button.

3. Place the **Change node** from the Functions section next to it.

{{< img src = "https://res.cloudinary.com/lukasfabik/image/upload/v1566368245/projects/smart-washing-machine/image3.png" alt = "Add change node to flow" >}}

4. Inside the Change node, **set up a message** that will be sent to your parents‚Äô mobile after the washing is done. The message should be free of diacritics.
   Here‚Äôs a little inspiration:
       - There‚Äôs clean laundry for you.
       - I am finished. Do I get a week holiday now?
       - Done and leave me alone. Your washing machine.

{{< img src = "https://res.cloudinary.com/lukasfabik/image/upload/v1566368245/projects/smart-washing-machine/image5.png" alt = "Set message to show" >}}

Confirm it with the **Done** button.

## Set up your mobile

1. It‚Äôs time to steal your mom‚Äôs or dad‚Äôs mobile and set up their own Blynk. If you don‚Äôt know how to do it yet, [**check out the instructions**]({{< ref "/education/tutorials/how-to-connect-blynk.en.md" >}}).
2. Create a **new project** in Blynk. Now a token has been sent to your email, but don‚Äôt do anything with it just yet.
3. On the Blynk desktop, **place the notification**.

{{< img src = "https://res.cloudinary.com/lukasfabik/image/upload/v1566368247/projects/smart-washing-machine/image11.png" alt = "Add Blynk Notify widget" >}}
{{< /middle >}}

4. **Start the project** with the Play button at the top right.

{{< middle >}}
{{< img src = "https://res.cloudinary.com/lukasfabik/image/upload/v1566368245/projects/smart-washing-machine/image6.png" alt = "Set Blynk Notify widget" >}}
{{< /middle >}}

## Finish the programming

1. Go back to your computer. Place the last node, **Notify** from the Blynk ws section, on the Node-RED desktop.

{{< img src = "https://res.cloudinary.com/lukasfabik/image/upload/v1566368247/projects/smart-washing-machine/image9.png" alt = "Add Blynk Notify node" >}}

2. Double-click on the node. Then click on the **pencil**. ‚úè

{{< img src = "https://res.cloudinary.com/lukasfabik/image/upload/v1566368245/projects/smart-washing-machine/image1.png" alt = "Blynk Connection settings" >}}

3. A window has opened for pairing with Blynk. Set the **URL** and the **Project Token** here. As always, you copy the URL from the bottom section of the image and receive the project token to your mailbox after creating a new project in Blynk.

{{< img src = "https://res.cloudinary.com/lukasfabik/image/upload/v1566368245/projects/smart-washing-machine/image8_new.png" alt = "Blynk Connection settings" >}}

**Our tip:** In the Name field, set the **name** of the project to recognize it better.

Confirm everything with the **Add** and **Done** buttons.

4. All you have to do now is **connect** and send a command to the space with the red **Deploy** button on the top right. üëè

## Give it a spin!

1. **Put the box on the washing machine.** Stick it with a small piece of tape to prevent it from falling.
2. **The box will recognize when the washing machine finishes**, because it will stop shaking.  It will send a message to your mom‚Äôs or dad‚Äôs mobile. Cool, huh? All of a sudden, you are **living in a smart household**! ü§°
