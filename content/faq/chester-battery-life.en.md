title: How long does the CHESTER run on battery power?
weight: 70

CHESTER is designed as a very low power consumption device. It is powered by a LiSoCl2 lithium primary cell with a nominal voltage of 3.6 V. This type of battery spontaneously loses only 3% of its capacity per year. By economical metering and communication setup, we can ensure a lifetime of several years. The run time for your specific application depends on the frequency of reading and sending data. Using external CHESTER-B battery modules, the capacity can be increased several times.
