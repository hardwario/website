Preferably by asking the operator of the network in question. CHESTER is also offered as an CHESTER Signal to test NB-IoT/LTE-M signal quality. To reduce the risk of the purchased device not being functional at the point of installation, we offer a 100 day testing period with a money back guarantee.
