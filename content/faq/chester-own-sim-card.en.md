Yes, you can use your own NB-IoT/LTE-M SIM card. However, you have to think about running your own backend infrastructure. Alternatively, you can use a HARDWARIO SIM card or SIM chip in conjunction with HARDWARIO Cloud and the integration of the device with your service is done via REST API or via callback (webhook).
